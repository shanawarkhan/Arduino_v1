Events
data The "data" event is fired as frequently as the user defined freq will allow in milliseconds. ("data" replaced the "read" event)

change The "change" event is fired whenever a change within the motion detection field is observed.

motionstart The "motionstart" event is fired when motion occurs within the observable range of the PIR/Motion/IR.Proximity sensor

motionend The "motionend" event is fired when motion has ceased within the observable range of the PIR/Motion/IR.Proximity sensor.

calibrated The "calibrated" event is fired when PIR/Motion sensor is ready to detect movement/motion in observable range. (PIR/Motion ONLY)
